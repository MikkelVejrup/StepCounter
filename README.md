## Stepcounter app by Daniel and Mikkel
------------------------------------

### For the application to work
For the application to work correctly, the application did need to be downloaded on a physical device and allow the application to use physical activity, which will allow it to use the step sensor

---

The application can calculate how many steps you may take etch day by knowing your age and activity level.
It saves how many steps have taken the past seven days using MySQL light (Room).
The application uses android services to track how many steps are taken when the application is closed.
